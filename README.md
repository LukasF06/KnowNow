### KnowNow
## What is it?

KnowNow is a webapplication, which should help students to study. You can just create your own learning sets and study them. You can create as much learning sets as you want.
In the learning mode, the app will ask you your question and then you will have to answer them. When you wrote down the wrong answer, you will have to correct yourself. When you wrote down the correct answer, it will continue with the next questions.

## Plans in the future:

In the future, I plan to make a second learning mode which should work like index cards or something like multiple choice.
